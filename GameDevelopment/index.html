      <p class="indented-text col-md-12">My very first game project, and…it shows. It is far from ideal, but I am still
        satisfied with it, given the absolute zero experience I had leading up to it. I am not an artist, and while I
        have begun taking up more artistic hobbies recently, in order to improve my ability to work solo on projects
        such as this, this project was before then. As our first individual project, we were required to create every
        asset ourselves, including a thirty-second introduction animation for the game. As stressful as it was, this
        project allowed me to prove to myself that I am capable of much, and that as long as I continue to invest time
        into developing my skills, both in programming and design, I would make it far. As for the game itself, Moai
        Mayhem is a game where you, a magical floating head of stone, must collect crystals and coins in order to stop
        the volcano’s eruption, in order to save the island.

      <p class="indented-text">For my first group project at GIMM, we were tasked with making some sort of mobile game for android that utilized both image tracking and plane tracking 
        for various mechanics. For our game, we decided to make a platformer where the player had to navigate the area of a house whilst avoiding enemies and obstacles, such as evil dust bunnies
        and fire ants. For our mechanics, we used Image tracking to activate powerups for the player, and plane tracking a 3D house you select in order to open the game. This was my first time
        working with other people and having to debug their code, and it was certainly a learning experience. Being able to look through someone else's thought process in how they code is 
        definitely a hard skill to gain, and I believe I've improved greatly since this project, having worked now worked as a peer mentor, where my whole job has been to go through other students' code.

      <p class="indented-text">
        Schrodunnit was a game/interactive comic created by me and my friends for our GIMM 250 class. The goal of this project was to take a complicated topic from quantum physics, and use a comic and game mechanics
        to try and explain it. Our group was assigned the topic of Schrodinger's Cat, and we decided to take an odd approach by making it a psuedo murder-mystery, where you cannot determine if anyone was 
        ever actually murdered or not. We experimented with the Ink dialogue system plugin for Unity throughout this project to create unique dialogue options.
