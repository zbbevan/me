      <p class="indented-text">Hello! I’m Zack Bevan, a student studying at Boise State University in the Games,
        Interactive Media, and Mobile program (GIMM). I’m currently in my second year, and amongst all the many career
        paths that GIMM supports and trains for, I have excelled the most at front end development. I specialize in
        working
        in unity, and have a passion for XR design and game development. I love working creatively in tech, whether the
        project be for storytelling, or just for innovation itself.</p>

      <p class="indented-text">In the relatively short time I’ve been at GIMM, not only have I proven myself as a
        competent programmer, I have also shown to be a strong leader. Whether I wanted to or not, I have been put in
        positions of leadership in every single group project I’ve been a part of in this program so far. Even as “lead
        programmer”, I was required to make decisions and provide guidance to the artists of our groups, when our art
        leads weren’t measuring up. Challenging as it is, I believe that being in these positions provide me with even
        more experience working in Unity than if I had simply been another programmer, only doing my assigned section of
        code. I better understand how my code needs to interact with the other elements of a project, such as assets,
        game environment, and even the types of controls being used to play our games. </p>

      <p class="indented-text">It is thanks to my past experiences that have allowed me to excel in these unfamiliar
        projects. Prior to starting in GIMM, I worked for the Meridian Library District at their business library and
        maker space, unBound. My days at unBound were spent setting up 3D prints, maintaining the library’s machines,
        and helping patrons with whatever they needed help with. Often, I was challenged with the needs of those
        patrons, having to learn how to do something for myself, just so I could show them how. It is thanks to this
        experience that I am able to learn, that I can face new tasks, new challenges, and still perform.</p>

      <p class="indented-text">
        Since January of 2024, I have also been working part time for the GIMM department, and this last semester, I was
        given the opportunity to work as a Peer Mentor in the lab on the weekends. As a Peer Mentor, it has been my job
        to work with first-year GIMM students, and assist them in debugging and completing their first game projects.
        Much like my library job, this position has proven to be a learning experience, often challenging me with
        unfamiliar ways of writing code, errors I’m unfamiliar with, and concepts of mechanics that I had not yet tried.
        I have become increasingly capable in my ability to find solutions, even in fields and contexts that are
        otherwise unfamiliar to me. It is for that reason that I believe my still small amount of experience is a
        strength, rather than a weakness.

        While I might be a young developer, and still in the early stages of my learning, I believe I am ready to take
        on more opportunities, and the challenges that come with them. I am prepared to learn whatever is needed of me,
        wherever I end up.
